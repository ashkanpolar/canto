# How can I add arbitrary links?

You may want to add several links, like a link to your terms or a friend's store. To do this, we need to create a link list. To do so, follow those steps:

1. Go to your Vend store dashboard.
2. On the left sidebar, click on "Design", then ""Navigation".
3. Click on the "Create a new navigation list" button.
4. In the "Name" field, enter what you want, like "Footer Links". Copy the "Handle" value somewhere (you'll need it later).
5. Add the links you want, and save.
